## How It Works

The Seam Carving algorithm removes pixels from an image in a way that minimizes the impact on the visual content. It identifies seams, which are paths of pixels that extend from the top to the bottom of the image. The algorithm evaluates the importance of each pixel based on its surrounding pixels and removes the least important seams.

### Steps in the Seam Carving Process:

1. **Energy Calculation**: The algorithm calculates the energy of each pixel using methods like gradient magnitude or saliency detection.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: It constructs a cost matrix using dynamic programming to find the optimal seams.
3. **Seam Removal**: The identified seams are removed from the image, resulting in a resized image that maintains important content.

## Key Concepts

### Computer Vision

Computer vision is a field that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world. Seam Carving falls under this category as it processes images to achieve content-aware resizing.

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. In Seam Carving, it efficiently computes the optimal seams to remove from the image.

### Image Manipulation

Image manipulation involves altering images to achieve desired effects. This tool allows users to resize images while keeping important features intact.

### Saliency Detection

Saliency detection identifies regions in an image that stand out. This information is crucial for determining which parts of the image to preserve during resizing.
